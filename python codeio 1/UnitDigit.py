#Unit Digit
'''
In Python, the unit digit (also known as the ones digit or last digit)
of a number is the rightmost digit in the number.
You can easily get it using the modulo operator (%).

✅ Explanation:

The % (modulo) operator gives the remainder when a number is divided by 10.
The remainder is always the last digit.
